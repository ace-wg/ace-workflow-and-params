Short Distribution Chain (SDC) Workflow and New OAuth Parameters for the
  Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)
                               Framework
               draft-ietf-ace-workflow-and-params-latest

Abstract

   This document updates the Authentication and Authorization for
   Constrained Environments framework (ACE, RFC 9200) as follows. (1) It
   defines the Short Distribution Chain (SDC) workflow that the
   authorization server (AS) can use for uploading an access token to a
   resource server on behalf of the client. (2) For the OAuth 2.0 token
   endpoint, it defines new parameters and encodings and it extends the
   semantics of the "ace_profile" parameter. (3) For the OAuth 2.0
   authz-info endpoint, it defines a new parameter and its encoding. (4)
   It defines how the client and the AS can coordinate on the exchange
   of the client's and resource server's public authentication
   credentials, when those can be transported by value or identified by
   reference; this extends the semantics of the "rs_cnf" parameter for
   the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint, thus updating RFC 9201. (5) It extends
   the error handling at the AS, for which it defines a new error code.
   (6) It deprecates the original payload format of error responses
   conveying an error code, when CBOR is used to encode message
   payloads.  For those responses, it defines a new payload format
   aligned with RFC 9290, thus updating in this respect also the
   profiles defined in RFC 9202, RFC 9203, and RFC 9431. (7) It amends
   two of the requirements on profiles of the framework.

1.  Introduction

   The Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
   (ACE) framework [RFC9200] defines an architecture to enforce access
   control for constrained devices.  A client (C) requests an assertion
   of granted permissions from an authorization server (AS) in the form
   of an access token, then uploads the access token to the target
   resource server (RS), and finally accesses protected resources at the
   RS according to the permissions specified in the access token.

   The framework has as main building blocks the OAuth 2.0 framework
   [RFC6749], the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] for
   message transfer, Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
   [RFC8949] for compact encoding, and CBOR Object Signing and
   Encryption (COSE) [RFC9052][RFC9053] for self-contained protection of
   access tokens.  In addition, separate profile documents define in
   detail how the participants in the ACE architecture communicate,
   especially as to the security protocols that they use.

   The present document updates [RFC9200] as follows.

   *  It defines the Short Distribution Chain (SDC) workflow for the ACE
      framework (see Section 2 of the present document), according to
      which the AS uploads the access token to the RS on behalf of C and
      then informs C about the outcome.  The SDC workflow is especially
      convenient in deployments where the communication leg between C
      and the RS is constrained, but the communication leg between the
      AS and the RS is not.

      The SDC workflow has no ambition to replace the original workflow
      defined in [RFC9200].  The AS can use one workflow or the other,
      depending, for example, on the specific RS for which an access
      token has been issued and the nature of the communication leg with
      that RS.

   *  It defines new parameters and encodings for the OAuth 2.0 token
      endpoint at the AS (see Section 3 of the present document).  These
      include:

      -  "token_upload", used by C to inform the AS that it opts in to
         use the SDC workflow and by the AS to inform C about the
         outcome of the token uploading to the RS per the SDC workflow.

      -  "token_hash", used by the AS to provide C with a token hash,
         which corresponds to an access token that the AS has issued for
         C and has successfully uploaded to the RS on behalf of C per
         the SDC workflow.

      -  "to_rs", used by C to provide the AS with information to relay
         to the RS, upon asking the AS to upload the access token to the
         RS per the SDC workflow.  Its specific use with the OSCORE
         profile [RFC9203] is also described, as effectively enabling
         the use of the SDC workflow for that profile.

      -  "from_rs", used by the AS to provide C with information to
         relay from the RS, after the AS has successfully uploaded the
         access token to the RS per the SDC workflow.  Its specific use
         with the OSCORE profile [RFC9203] is also described, as
         effectively enabling the use of the SDC workflow for that
         profile.

      -  "rs_cnf2", used by the AS to provide C with the public keys of
         the RSs in the group-audience for which the access token is
         issued (see Section 6.9 of [RFC9200]).

      -  "audience2", used by the AS to provide C with the identifiers
         of the RSs in the group-audience for which the access token is
         issued.

      -  "anchor_cnf", used by the AS to provide C with the public keys
         of trust anchors, which C can use to validate the public key of
         an RS (e.g., as provided in the "rs_cnf" parameter defined in
         [RFC9201] or in the "rs_cnf2" parameter defined in the present
         document).

      -  "token_series_id", used by the AS to provide C with the binary
         identifier of a token series and by C to ask the AS for a new
         access token in the same token series that dynamically updates
         access rights.  A corresponding access token claim, namely
         "token_series_id", is also defined.

      -  "updated_rights", used by the AS to provide the RS with an
         indication that an access token uploaded per the SDC workflow
         is not the first one of a new token series, i.e., that the AS
         has issued the access token for dynamically updating the access
         rights of C.

   *  It extends the semantics of the "ace_profile" parameter for the
      OAuth 2.0 token endpoint at the authorization server defined in
      [RFC9200] (see Section 4 of the present document).

   *  It defines how C and the AS can coordinate on the exchange of the
      client's and resource server's public authentication credentials,
      when those can be transported by value or identified by reference
      in the access token request and response (see Section 5 of the
      present document).

      This extends the semantics of the "rs_cnf" parameter for the OAuth
      2.0 token endpoint defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9201].
      Therefore, it updates [RFC9201].

   *  It extends the error handling at the AS, for which it defines a
      new error code that the AS can use for error responses sent to the
      client, after failing to verify the proof of possession of the
      client's private key when processing an access token request (see
      Section 6 of the present document).

   *  It deprecates the original payload format of error responses that
      convey an error code, when CBOR is used to encode message payloads
      in the ACE framework.  For such error responses, it defines a new
      payload format according to the problem-details format specified
      in [RFC9290] (see Section 7 of the present document).

      In this respect, it also updates the profiles of the ACE framework
      defined in [RFC9202], [RFC9203], and [RFC9431].

   *  It amends two of the requirements on profiles of the ACE framework
      originally compiled in Appendix C of [RFC9200] (see Section 8 of
      the present document).

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization
   [RFC9200][RFC9201], as well as with terms and concepts related to
   CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) [RFC8392] and CWT Confirmation Methods
   [RFC8747].

   The terminology for entities in the considered architecture is
   defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  In particular, this includes client
   (C), resource server (RS), and authorization server (AS).

   Readers are also expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to CoAP [RFC7252], Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
   [RFC8610], CBOR [RFC8949], JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   [RFC8259], and COSE [RFC9052][RFC9053].

   Note that the term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth
   definition [RFC6749], aimed at denoting resources such as /token and
   /introspect at the AS, and /authz-info at the RS.  The CoAP
   definition, which is "[a]n entity participating in the CoAP protocol"
   [RFC7252], is not used in this document.

   Furthermore, this document uses the following terms.

   *  Token series: a set of access tokens, all of which are bound to
      the same proof-of-possession (PoP) key and are sequentially issued
      by the same AS for the same pair (client, audience) per the same
      profile of ACE.  A token series ends when the latest access token
      of that token series becomes invalid (e.g., when it expires or
      gets revoked).

      Profiles of ACE can provide their extended and specialized
      definition, e.g., by further taking into account the public
      authentication credentials of C and the RS.

   *  Token hash: identifier of an access token, in binary format
      encoding.  The token hash has no relation with other access token
      identifiers possibly used, such as the 'cti' (CWT ID) claim of
      CWTs [RFC8392].

   CBOR [RFC8949] and CDDL [RFC8610] are used in this document.  CDDL
   predefined type names, especially bstr for CBOR byte strings and tstr
   for CBOR text strings, are used extensively in this document.

   Examples throughout this document are expressed in CBOR diagnostic
   notation as defined in Section 8 of [RFC8949] and Appendix G of
   [RFC8610].  Diagnostic notation comments are often used to provide a
   textual representation of the parameters' keys and values.

   In the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this document, constructs of
   the form e'SOME_NAME' are replaced by the value assigned to SOME_NAME
   in the CDDL model shown in Figure 11 of Appendix B.  For example,
   {e'audience2' : ["rs1", "rs2"]} stands for {54 : ["rs1", "rs2"]}.

   Note to RFC Editor: Please delete the paragraph immediately preceding
   this note.  Also, in the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this
   document, please replace the constructs of the form e'SOME_NAME' with
   the value assigned to SOME_NAME in the CDDL model shown in Figure 11
   of Appendix B.  Finally, please delete this note.

2.  The Short Distribution Chain (SDC) Workflow

   As defined in Section 4 of [RFC9200], the ACE framework relies on its
   basic protocol workflow shown in Figure 1.

   That is, the client first sends an access token request to the token
   endpoint at the AS (Step A), specifying permissions that it seeks to
   obtain for accessing protected resources at the RS, possibly together
   with information on its own public authentication credential.

   Then, if the request is successfully verified, authenticated, and
   authorized, the AS replies to the client with an access token
   response (Step B), providing an access token and possibly additional
   parameters as access information including the actually granted
   permissions.

   Finally, the client uploads the access token to the RS and,
   consistently with the permissions granted according to the access
   token, accesses a resource at the RS (Step C), which replies with the
   result of the resource access (Step F).  Details about what protocol
   the client and the RS use to establish a secure association, mutually
   authenticate, and secure their communications are defined in the
   specific profile of ACE used, e.g., [RFC9202][RFC9203][RFC9431][I-D.i
   etf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile][I-D.ietf-ace-group-oscore-profile].

   Further interactions are possible between the AS and the RS, i.e.,
   the exchange of an introspection request and response where the AS
   validates a previously issued access token for the RS (Steps D and
   E).

                   Figure 1: ACE Basic Protocol Workflow.

   This section defines the alternative Short Distribution Chain (SDC)
   workflow shown in Figure 2, which MAY be supported by the AS.  Unlike
   in the original workflow defined in [RFC9200], the AS uploads the
   access token to the RS on behalf of the client and then informs the
   client about the outcome.

   If the token uploading has been successfully completed, the client
   typically does not need to obtain the access token from the AS
   altogether.  That is, the client simply establishes a secure
   association with the RS (if that has not happened already) and then
   accesses protected resources at the RS, according to the permissions
   granted per the access token and specified by the AS as access
   information.

         Figure 2: ACE Short Distribution Chain (SDC) Workflow.

   More specifically, the SDC workflow consists of the following steps.

   *  Step A - Like in the original workflow, the client sends an access
      token request to the token endpoint at the AS, with the additional
      indication that it opts in to use the SDC workflow.

      As defined in Section 3.1, this indication is provided to the AS
      by means of the "token_upload" parameter included in the access
      token request.  The parameter also specifies what the AS has to
      return in the access token response at Step B, following a
      successful uploading of the access token from the AS to the RS.

   *  Step A1 - This new step consists of the AS uploading the access
      token to the RS, typically at the authz-info endpoint, just like
      the client does in the original workflow.

   *  Step A2 - This new step consists of the RS replying to the AS,
      following the uploading of the access token at Step A1.

   *  Step B - In the access token response, the AS informs the client
      that it has attempted to upload the access token to the RS,
      specifying the outcome of the token uploading based on the reply
      received from the RS at Step A2.

      As defined in Section 3.1, this information is provided to the
      client by means of the "token_upload" parameter included in the
      access token response.  If the token uploading has failed, the
      access token response also includes the access token.  Otherwise,
      the access token response includes information consistent with
      what was specified by the "token_upload" parameter of the access
      token request at Step A.

   *  Step C1 - This step occurs only if the token uploading from the AS
      has failed, and the AS has provided the client with the access
      token at Step B.  In such a case, the client uploads the access
      token to the RS just like at Step C of the original workflow.

   *  Step C2 - The client attempts to access a protected resource at
      the RS, according to the permissions granted per the access token
      and specified by the AS as access information at Step B.

   *  Steps D, E, and F are like in the original workflow.

   The SDC workflow has no ambition to replace the original workflow
   defined in [RFC9200].  The AS can use one workflow or the other,
   depending, for example, on the specific RS for which the access token
   has been issued and the nature of the communication leg with that RS.

   When using the SDC workflow, all the communications between the AS
   and the RS MUST be protected, consistent with Sections 5.8.4.3 and
   6.5 of [RFC9200].  Unlike in the original workflow, this results in
   protecting also the uploading of the first access token in a token
   series, i.e., in addition to the uploading of the following access
   tokens in the token series for dynamically updating the access rights
   of the client.

   The SDC workflow is also suitable for deployments where clients are
   not aware of details such as the need for access tokens to be issued
   by the AS and uploaded at the RS.  Consistent with the intended
   access policies, the AS can be configured to automatically issue
   access tokens for such clients and upload those access tokens to the
   RS.  This means that such clients do not have to request for an
   access token to be issued in the first place.  That is, they can
   immediately send requests to the RS for accessing its protected
   resources, in accordance with the access tokens already issued and
   uploaded by the AS.

2.1.  Token Upload

   When using the original workflow defined in [RFC9200], there are two
   typical cases concerning the upload of the access token to the RS
   from C.

   *  The first case considers the upload of the first access token in a
      token series.  While details depend on the specific profile of ACE
      used, such an access token is typically uploaded through an
      unprotected POST request to the authz-info endpoint.

   *  The second case considers the upload of an access token that is
      not the first in its token series, i.e., the AS has issued the
      access token for dynamically updating the access rights of C.  The
      intent is also for C and the RS to preserve the same secure
      communication association that they currently share and that is
      associated with the token series in question.

      Such an access token is uploaded through a POST request to the
      authz-info endpoint, which is protected by means of the secure
      communication association that is shared between C and the RS.  If
      the new access token is accepted by the RS, the new access token
      supersedes the one currently stored for the token series in
      question, and it becomes associated with the corresponding secure
      communication association that is shared between C and the RS.

   However, if the AS uploads the access token to the RS on behalf of C
   as per the SDC workflow, the upload of the access token always rely
   on a protected POST request from the AS to the authz-info endpoint.
   In particular, the request is protected with the secure communication
   association shared between the AS and the RS.

   When receiving a POST request to the authz-info endpoint that is
   specifically protected through the secure communication association
   shared with the AS, the RS proceeds as follows.  In particular, the
   RS leverages the explicit indication provided by the AS through the
   "updated_rights" parameter defined in Section 3.7, which is included
   in the request in the case of dynamic update of access rights.

   *  If the request does not include the "updated_rights" parameter,
      the RS processes the request and the access token therein like it
      would when receiving the request from C and according to the
      specific profile of ACE used.  The access token in question is the
      first one in a token series.

   *  If the request includes the "updated_rights" parameter encoding
      the CBOR simple value true (0xf5), then the access token in
      question, namely T_NEW, is not the first one in its token series,
      i.e., it is meant to dynamically update the access rights of C,
      while preserving the same secure communication association that is
      shared between C and the RS.

      In this case, the RS uses lookup information specified within
      T_NEW to determine whether it stores an access token T_OLD
      associated with C and belonging to the same token series of T_NEW.
      Such lookup information includes an identifier of the token series
      to which both T_NEW and T_OLD belong, and it can further comprise
      additional information elements pertaining to the specific profile
      of ACE used (e.g., the authentication credential of C that is
      bound to the access tokens of the token series).

      By leveraging such lookup information, the RS checks whether it
      stores an access token T_OLD that belongs to the same token series
      of T_NEW, like it would when receiving the request from C and
      according to the specific profile of ACE used.

      If the RS is currently storing such an old access token T_OLD and
      successfully validates the access token T_NEW, then the RS MUST
      supersede T_OLD by replacing the corresponding authorization
      information with the one specified in the new access token T_NEW.
      After that, the RS MUST associate T_NEW with the same secure
      communication association with which T_OLD was associated.

      If the RS is not currently storing such an old access token T_OLD,
      then the RS MUST reject the POST request from the AS and MUST
      reply with an error response that has a response code equivalent
      to the CoAP code 5.00 (Internal Server Error).

   The explicit indication provided by the "updated_rights" parameter
   prevents possible ambiguous situations, where the RS might
   erroneously believe that an access token is the first one in a new
   token series (e.g., following the deletion of stored access tokens
   due to memory limitations).

3.  New Parameters

   The rest of this section defines a number of additional parameters
   and encodings for the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint at the AS (see
   Section 5.8 of [RFC9200]) and for the OAuth 2.0 authz-info endpoint
   at the RS (see Section 5.10.1 of [RFC9200]).

3.1.  token_upload

   This section defines the additional "token_upload" parameter.  The
   parameter can be used in an access token request sent by C to the
   token endpoint at the AS (see Section 5.8.1 of [RFC9200]), as well as
   in the access token response sent as a reply by the AS (see
   Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]).

   *  The "token_upload" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an access
      token request.  The presence of this parameter indicates that C
      opts in to use the SDC workflow defined in Section 2, whose actual
      use for uploading the issued access token to the RS is an
      exclusive prerogative of the AS.

      This parameter can take one of the following integer values.  When
      the access token request is encoded in CBOR, those values are
      encoded as CBOR unsigned integers.  The value of the parameter
      determines whether the follow-up access token response will have
      to include certain information, in case the AS has successfully
      uploaded the access token to the RS.

      -  0: The access token response will have to include neither the
         access token nor its corresponding token hash.

      -  1: The access token response will have to include the token
         hash corresponding to the access token, but not the access
         token.

      -  2: The access token response will have to include the access
         token, but not the corresponding token hash.

      If the AS supports the SDC workflow and the access token request
      includes the "token_upload" parameter with value 0, 1, or 2, then
      the AS MAY use the SDC workflow to upload the access token to the
      RS on behalf of C.  Otherwise, following that access token
      request, the AS MUST NOT use the SDC workflow.

   *  The "token_upload" parameter MUST be included in an access token
      response, if both the following conditions apply.  Otherwise, the
      "token_upload" parameter MUST NOT be included.

      -  The corresponding access token request included the
         "token_upload" parameter, with value 0, 1, or 2.

      -  The AS has attempted to upload the issued access token to the
         RS as per the SDC workflow, irrespective of the result of the
         token upload.

      When the "token_upload" parameter is included in the access token
      response, it can take one of the following integer values.  When
      the access token response is encoded in CBOR, those values are
      encoded as CBOR unsigned integers.

      -  If the token upload to the RS was not successful, then the
         "token_upload" parameter MUST encode the value 1.

         In this case, the access token response MUST include the
         "access_token" parameter specifying the issued access token.

      -  If the token upload at the RS was successful, then the
         "token_upload" parameter MUST encode the value 0.

         In this case, the access token response can include additional
         parameters as defined below, depending on the value of the
         "token_upload" parameter in the corresponding access token
         request.

         o  If the "token_upload" parameter in the access token request
            specified the value 0, then the access token response MUST
            NOT include the "access_token" parameter and MUST NOT
            include the "token_hash" parameter defined in Section 3.2.

         o  If the "token_upload" parameter in the access token request
            specified the value 1, then the access token response MUST
            NOT include the "access_token" parameter and MUST include
            the "token_hash" parameter defined in Section 3.2,
            specifying the hash corresponding to the issued access token
            and computed as defined in Section 3.2.

         o  If the "token_upload" parameter in the access token request
            specified the value 2, then the access token response MUST
            include the "access_token" parameter specifying the issued
            access token and MUST NOT include the "token_hash" parameter
            defined in Section 3.2.

3.1.1.  Examples

   Figure 3 shows an example, with first an access token request from C
   to the AS and then an access token response from the AS to C,
   following the issue of an access token bound to a symmetric PoP key.

   The access token request specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 0.  That is, C indicates that it requires neither the access
   token nor the corresponding token hash from the AS, in case the AS
   successfully uploads the access token to the RS.

   The access token response specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 0, which indicates that the AS has successfully uploaded the
   access token to the RS on behalf of C.

   Consistent with the value of the "token_upload" parameter in the
   access token request, the access token response includes neither the
   access token nor its corresponding token hash.  The access token
   response also includes the "cnf" parameter specifying the symmetric
   PoP key bound to the access token.

          }
        }
      }

        Figure 3: Example of Access Token Request-Response Exchange.
      Following a successful uploading of the access token from the AS
      to the RS, the access token response includes the "token_upload"
     parameter but not the access token, which is bound to a symmetric
                 key and was uploaded to the RS by the AS.

   Figure 4 shows another example, with first an access token request
   from C to the AS and then an access token response from the AS to C,
   also following the issue of an access token bound to a symmetric PoP
   key.

   The access token request specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 2.  That is, C indicates that it requires the access token from
   the AS, even in case the AS successfully uploads the access token to
   the RS.

   The access token response specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 0, which indicates that the AS has successfully uploaded the
   access token to the RS on behalf of C.

   Consistent with the value of the "token_upload" parameter in the
   access token request, the access token response includes the
   "access_token" parameter specifying the issued access token.  The
   access token response also includes the "cnf" parameter specifying
   the symmetric PoP key bound to the access token.

          }
        }
      }

        Figure 4: Example of Access Token Request-Response Exchange.
      Following a successful uploading of the access token from the AS
      to the RS, the access token response includes the "token_upload"
      parameter as well as the "access_token" parameter conveying the
      access token, which is bound to a symmetric key and was uploaded
                            to the RS by the AS.

   Figure 5 shows another example, with first an access token request
   from C to the AS and then an access token response from the AS to C,
   also following the issue of an access token bound to a symmetric PoP
   key.

   The access token request specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 0.  That is, C indicates that it requires neither the access
   token nor the corresponding token hash from the AS, in case the AS
   successfully uploads the access token to the RS.

   In this example, the access token response includes the
   "token_upload" parameter with value 1, which indicates that the AS
   has attempted and failed to upload the access token to the RS on
   behalf of C.  The access token response also includes the
   "access_token" parameter specifying the issued access token, together
   with the "cnf" parameter specifying the symmetric PoP key bound to
   the access token.

   Note that, even though the AS has failed to upload the access token
   to the RS, the response code 2.01 (Created) is used when replying to
   C, since the access token request as such has been successfully
   processed at the AS, with the following issue of the access token.

          }
        }
      }

        Figure 5: Example of Access Token Request-Response Exchange.
      Following a failed uploading of the access token from the AS to
       the RS, the access token response includes the "token_upload"
        parameter with value 1 as well the "access_token" parameter
            conveying the access token bound to a symmetric key.

3.2.  token_hash

   This section defines the additional "token_hash" parameter.  The
   parameter can be used in an access token response sent by the AS (see
   Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]), in reply to an access token request sent
   to the token endpoint by C.

   The following refers to the base64url encoding without padding (see
   Section 5 of [RFC4648]) and denotes as "binary representation" of a
   text string the corresponding UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629], which is the
   implied charset used in JSON (see Section 8.1 of [RFC8259]).

   The "token_hash" parameter MUST be included in an access token
   response, if both the following conditions apply.  Otherwise, it MUST
   NOT be included.

   *  The corresponding access token request included the "token_upload"
      parameter with value 1 (see Section 3.1).

   *  The access token response includes the "token_upload" parameter
      with value 0.  That is, the AS has successfully uploaded the
      issued access token to the RS, as per the SDC workflow.

   This parameter specifies the token hash corresponding to the access
   token issued by the AS and successfully uploaded to the RS on behalf
   of C.  In particular:

   *  If the access token response is encoded in CBOR, then the
      "token_hash" parameter is a CBOR byte string, with value the token
      hash.

   *  If the access token response is encoded in JSON, then the
      "token_hash" parameter has as value the base64url-encoded text
      string that encodes the token hash.

   The AS computes the token hash as defined in Section 3.2.1.

3.2.1.  Computing the Token Hash

   The AS computes the token hash over the value that the "access_token"
   parameter would have had in the same access token response, if it was
   included therein and specifying the access token.

   In particular, the input HASH_INPUT over which the token hash is
   computed is determined as follows.

   *  If the access token response is encoded in CBOR, then:

      -  BYTES denotes the value of the CBOR byte string that would be
         conveyed by the "access_token" parameter, if this was included
         in the access token response.

      -  HASH_INPUT_TEXT is the base64url-encoded text string that
         encodes BYTES.

      -  HASH_INPUT is the binary representation of HASH_INPUT_TEXT.

   *  If the access token response is encoded in JSON, then HASH_INPUT
      is the binary representation of the text string conveyed by the
      "access_token" parameter, if this was included in the access token
      response.

   Once determined HASH_INPUT as defined above, a hash value of
   HASH_INPUT is generated as per Section 6 of [RFC6920].  The resulting
   output in binary format is used as the token hash.  Note that the
   used binary format embeds the identifier of the used hash function in
   the first byte of the computed token hash.

   The specific hash function used MUST be collision resistant on byte
   strings and MUST be selected from the "Named Information Hash
   Algorithm Registry" [IANA.Hash.Algorithms].  Consistent with the
   compliance requirements in Section 2 of [RFC6920], the hash function
   sha-256 as specified in [SHA-256] is mandatory to implement.

   The computation of token hashes defined above is aligned with that
   specified for the computation of token hashes in Section 4 of
   [RFC9770], where they are used as identifiers of revoked access
   tokens.  Therefore, given a hash algorithm and an access token, the
   AS computes the same corresponding token hash in either case.

   If the AS supports the method specified in [RFC9770], then the AS
   MUST use the same hash algorithm for computing both the token hashes
   to include in the "token_hash" parameter and the token hashes
   computed per that method to identify revoked access tokens.

3.2.2.  Example

   Figure 6 shows an example, with first an access token request from C
   to the AS and then an access token response from the AS to C,
   following the issue of an access token bound to a symmetric PoP key.

   The access token request specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 1.  That is, C indicates that it requires the token hash
   corresponding to the access token from the AS, in case the AS
   successfully uploads the access token to the RS.

   The access token response specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 0, which indicates that the AS has successfully uploaded the
   access token to the RS on behalf of C.

   Consistent with the value of the "token_upload" parameter in the
   access token request, the access token response includes the
   "token_hash" parameter, which specifies the token hash corresponding
   to the issued access token.  The access token response also includes
   the "cnf" parameter specifying the symmetric PoP key bound to the
   access token.

          }
        }
      }

        Figure 6: Example of Access Token Request-Response Exchange.
      Following a successful uploading of the access token from the AS
      to the RS, the access token response includes the "token_upload"
           parameter as well as the "token_hash" parameter.  The
       "token_hash" parameter conveys the token hash corresponding to
       the issued access token, which is bound to a symmetric key and
                     was uploaded to the RS by the AS.

3.3.  to_rs and from_rs

   The rest of this section defines the additional parameters "to_rs"
   (see Section 3.3.1) and "from_rs" (see Section 3.3.2).

   The "to_rs" parameter can be used in an access token request sent by
   C to the token endpoint at the AS (see Section 5.8.1 of [RFC9200]).
   The "from_rs" parameter can be used in an access token response sent
   by the AS (see Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]), in reply to an access
   token request sent to the token endpoint by C.

   The semantics and encoding of the information specified in the two
   parameters depend on the specific profile of ACE and application
   used.

   For instance, when using the OSCORE profile [RFC9203], C and RS can
   use the two parameters to exchange the expected nonces and
   identifiers via the AS.  Section 3.3.3 describes how the two
   parameters are used when the OSCORE profile is used, thereby
   effectively enabling the use of the SDC workflow for that profile.

3.3.1.  to_rs

   The "to_rs" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an access token
   request.  The presence of this parameter indicates that:

   *  C wishes the AS to relay the information specified therein to the
      RS, when the AS uploads the issued access token to the RS per the
      SDC workflow defined in Section 2; and

   *  C wishes the AS to relay information received from the RS to C,
      after having successfully uploaded the access token to the RS per
      the SDC workflow defined in Section 2.

   The "to_rs" parameter MUST NOT be included if the "token_upload"
   parameter defined in Section 3.1 is not included in the access token
   request.  Also, this parameter MUST NOT be included if the requested
   access token is not the first one of a new token series, i.e., if C
   is asking the AS for a new access token in the same token series that
   dynamically updates access rights.

   If C wishes that the AS relays information from the RS after
   successfully uploading the access token, but C does not have any
   information to be relayed to the RS, then the following applies:

   *  When the access token request is encoded in CBOR, then the "to_rs"
      parameter MUST encode the CBOR simple value null (0xf6).

   *  When the access token request is encoded in JSON, then the "to_rs"
      parameter MUST have value null.

   Otherwise, this parameter specifies the information that C wishes the
   AS to relay to the RS, when uploading the access token to the RS on
   behalf of C.

   Such information consists in what C would provide to the RS in
   addition to the access token, if the original workflow was used and a
   POST request encoded in CBOR was sent to the authz-info endpoint at
   the RS.

   When composing the parameter "to_rs", C considers the same
   information and MUST wrap it in a data structure STRUCT, by using the
   same method that it employs when using the original workflow.  For
   example, with reference to the OSCORE profile of ACE [RFC9203], such
   a method composes STRUCT as a CBOR map, which has to be sent as
   payload of a request with Content-Format "application/ace+cbor".

   After that, C builds a CBOR byte string STR, whose value is the
   binary representation of STRUCT.

   If and only if the request to the authz-info endpoint has to be sent
   with a Content-Format ct different from the one employed in the
   profile of ACE used, then C MUST tag the CBOR byte string STR (see
   Section 3.4 of [RFC8949]).  The tag number TN MUST be the one
   associated with the Content-Format ct and is determined according to
   the technique described in Appendix B of [RFC9277].  For example, the
   Content-Format "application/ace+cbor" has Content-Format ID 19 and
   therefore has 1668546836 as its associated tag number.

   When the access token request is encoded in CBOR, the value of the
   "to_rs" parameter is the (tagged) CBOR byte string STR.

   When the access token request is encoded in JSON, the value of the
   "to_rs" parameter is a text string, which encodes the binary
   representation of the (tagged) CBOR byte string STR in base64url
   without padding (see Section 5 of [RFC4648]).

   If the "to_rs" parameter is included, and it specifies a value
   different from the CBOR simple value null (0xf6) when the access
   token request is encoded in CBOR or from null when the access token
   request is encoded in JSON, then the AS proceeds as follows when
   composing the POST request to send to the authz-info endpoint on
   behalf of C:

   1.  The AS sets the Content-Format of the request to be either:

       *  the one employed in the profile of ACE used, if the CBOR byte
          string STR conveyed by the "to_rs" parameter is not tagged;
          or, otherwise,

       *  the one associated with the tag number TN of the tagged CBOR
          byte string STR conveyed by the "to_rs" parameter.

   2.  The AS retrieves the structure STRUCT from STR and extends STRUCT
       by adding the issued access token, consistently with the profile
       of ACE used and the Content-Format determined at the previous
       step.

       For example, when using the OSCORE profile of ACE [RFC9203] and
       thus the Content-Format to use is "application/ace+cbor", STRUCT
       is a CBOR map and the access token is included therein as an
       entry that has: as map key, 1 encoded as a CBOR integer; as map
       value, a CBOR byte string whose value is the binary
       representation of the access token.

   Clearly, performing the two steps above requires the AS to understand
   the structure STRUCT and its semantics.  In turn, such an
   understanding builds on the AS supporting the profile of ACE used and
   the Content-Format to use as determined at Step 1.  In the expected
   cases, the AS is realistically able to perform the two steps.  If the
   AS finds itself unable to perform the two steps, then the AS would
   simply not upload the access token to the RS on behalf of C.  In such
   a case, the AS replies to C with an access token response, which
   includes the "access_token" parameter specifying the issued access
   token and does not include the "token_upload" parameter (see
   Section 3.1).

   Tagging the CBOR byte string as defined above ensures that the AS can
   relay the information specified in the "to_rs" parameter as intended
   by C, i.e., by sending to the authz-info endpoint a POST request that
   has the correct Content-Format and conveys the correct payload.

   As a case in point, using the DTLS profile of ACE [RFC9202] typically
   results in a POST request to the authz-info endpoint with Content-
   Format "application/cwt", as per Section 5.10 of [RFC9200].  However,
   the DTLS profile of ACE can be combined with application profiles of
   [RFC9594].  In such a case, the POST request might convey both the
   access token and additional parameters from C (e.g., "sign_info"
   defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC9594]), which requires the request to
   have Content-Format "application/ace+cbor" (see Section 3.3 of
   [RFC9594]).

3.3.2.  from_rs

   The "from_rs" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an access token
   response.  The presence of this parameter indicates that the AS is
   relaying the information specified therein to C, which the AS has
   received from the RS after having successfully uploaded the access
   token to the RS per the SDC workflow defined in Section 2.

   The "from_rs" parameter MUST be included in an access token response
   if both the following conditions apply.  Otherwise, it MUST NOT be
   included.

   *  The corresponding access token request included the "to_rs"
      parameter (see Section 3.3.1).

   *  The access token response includes the "token_upload" parameter
      with value 0 (see Section 3.1).  That is, the AS has successfully
      uploaded the issued access token to the RS, as per the SDC
      workflow.

   This parameter specifies the information that the AS is relaying to C
   from the RS, following the successful upload of the access token to
   the RS on behalf of C.

   Such information consists in what C would receive from the RS, if the
   original workflow was used and the RS sent a successful response
   encoded in CBOR, in reply to a POST request to the authz-info
   endpoint.

   When composing the parameter "from_rs", the AS builds a CBOR byte
   string STR as follows:

   *  If the successful response from the authz-info endpoint does not
      include a payload, then STR is the empty CBOR byte string (0x40);
      otherwise,

   *  The value of STR is the payload of the successful response from
      the authz-info endpoint.

      If and only if the response specifies a given Content-Format ct
      (i.e., by means of the CoAP Content-Format Option), then the AS
      MUST tag the CBOR byte string STR (see Section 3.4 of [RFC8949]).
      The tag number TN MUST be the one associated with the Content-
      Format ct and is determined according to the technique described
      in Appendix B of [RFC9277].

   When the access token response is encoded in CBOR, the value of the
   "from_rs" parameter is the (tagged) CBOR byte string STR.

   When the access token response is encoded in JSON, the value of the
   "from_rs" parameter is a text string, which encodes the binary
   representation of the (tagged) CBOR byte string STR in base64url
   without padding (see Section 5 of [RFC4648]).

   When C receives from the AS the access token response specifying the
   "token_upload" parameter with value 0, C retrieves from the "from_rs"
   parameter the information relayed by the AS, just like when
   retrieving that information from a successful response with Content-
   Format ct that C receives from the RS when using the original
   workflow.

   In particular, if the CBOR byte string STR is not the empty CBOR byte
   string (0x40), C considers as the Content-Format ct either:

   *  the one employed in the profile of ACE used, if the CBOR byte
      string STR conveyed by the "from_rs" parameter is not tagged; or,
      otherwise,

   *  the one associated with the tag number TN of the tagged CBOR byte
      string STR conveyed by the "from_rs" parameter.

3.3.3.  Use with the OSCORE Profile

   This section describes how to use the parameters "to_rs" and
   "from_rs" when the OSCORE profile of ACE [RFC9203] is used.

   Within the access token request from C to the AS, the value of the
   "to_rs" parameter is a CBOR byte string, whose value is the binary
   representation of a CBOR map C_MAP composed of two fields:

   *  A field with the CBOR integer 40 as map key and with value the
      nonce N1 generated by C, encoded a CBOR byte string (see
      Section 4.1 of [RFC9203]).

   *  A field with the CBOR integer 43 as map key and with value the
      Recipient ID ID1 generated by C, encoded as a CBOR byte string
      (see Section 4.1 of [RFC9203]).

   When building the POST request for uploading the access token to the
   authz-info endpoint at the RS, the AS sets the Content-Format of the
   request to "application/ace+cbor" and composes the request payload as
   specified in Section 4.1 of [RFC9203].  In particular, the CBOR map
   specified as payload includes:

   *  The "access_token" field, with value the access token to upload
      encoded as a CBOR byte string and with the CBOR integer 1 as map
      key.

   *  The "nonce1" field, with value the same CBOR byte string specified
      by the field of C_MAP that has the CBOR integer 40 as map key.

   *  The "ace_client_recipientid" field, with value the same CBOR byte
      string specified by the field of C_MAP that has the CBOR integer
      43 as map key.

   If the upload of the access token to the RS from the AS is
   successful, the RS replies to the AS with a 2.01 (Created) response,
   which has Content-Format "application/ace+cbor" and whose payload is
   a CBOR map RS_MAP that includes:

   *  The "nonce2" field, with value the nonce N2 generated by the RS,
      encoded as a CBOR byte string (see Section 4.2 of [RFC9203]).

   *  The "ace_server_recipientid" field, with value the Recipient ID
      ID2 generated by the RS, encoded as a CBOR byte string (see
      Section 4.2 of [RFC9203]).

   Within the access token response from the AS to C, the value of the
   "from_rs" parameter is a CBOR byte string, whose value is the binary
   representation of a CBOR map composed of two elements:

   *  A field with the CBOR integer 42 as map key and with value the
      same CBOR byte string specified by the "nonce2" field of RS_MAP.

   *  A field with the CBOR integer 44 as map key and with value the
      same CBOR byte string specified by the "ace_server_recipientid"
      field of RS_MAP.

   When C receives from the AS the access token response specifying the
   "token_upload" parameter with value 0, C retrieves the nonce N2 and
   the Recipient ID ID2 from the "from_rs" parameter, just like when
   retrieving those from a 2.01 (Created) response received from the RS
   when using the original workflow.

   Figure 7 shows an example where the OSCORE profile is used, with
   first an access token request from C to the AS and then an access
   token response from the AS to C, following the issue of an access
   token bound to a symmetric PoP key.

   The access token request specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 0.  That is, C indicates that it requires neither the access
   token nor the corresponding token hash from the AS, in case the AS
   successfully uploads the access token to the RS.  Also, the access
   token request includes the "to_rs" parameter, specifying the values
   of N1 = 0x018a278f7faab55a and ID1 = 0x1645 intended to the RS.

   The access token response specifies the "token_upload" parameter with
   value 0, which indicates that the AS has successfully uploaded the
   access token to the RS on behalf of C.

   Consistent with the value of the "token_upload" parameter in the
   access token request, the access token response includes neither the
   access token nor its corresponding token hash.  The access token
   response also includes the "cnf" parameter specifying the symmetric
   PoP key bound to the access token, as an OSCORE_Input_Material object
   (see Section 3.2.1 of [RFC9203]).  Also, the access token response
   includes the "from_rs" parameter, specifying the values of N2 =
   0x25a8991cd700ac01 and ID2 = 0x0000 received from the RS and intended
   to C.

          }
      }

     Figure 7: Example of Access Token Request-Response Exchange where
      the OSCORE Profile is Used.  Following a successful uploading of
     the access token from the AS to the RS, the access token response
      includes the "token_upload" parameter but not the access token,
      which is bound to a symmetric key and was uploaded to the RS by
     the AS.  C and the RS exchange N1, ID1, N2, and ID2 via the AS by
               means of the parameters "to_rs" and "from_rs".

3.4.  rs_cnf2 and audience2

   This section defines the additional parameters "rs_cnf2" and
   "audience2".  The two parameters can be used in an access token
   response sent by the AS (see Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]), in reply to
   an access token request sent to the token endpoint by C.

   *  The "rs_cnf2" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an access token
      response, if the token type is "pop", asymmetric keys are used,
      and the access token is issued for an audience that includes
      multiple RSs (i.e., a group-audience, see Section 6.9 of
      [RFC9200]).  Otherwise, the "rs_cnf2" parameter MUST NOT be
      included.

      Also, the "rs_cnf2" parameter MUST NOT be included if the issued
      access token is not the first one of a new token series.

      This parameter specifies information about the public keys used by
      the RSs of the group-audience for authenticating themselves to C.
      It is used in case the binding between the public keys and the
      corresponding RS identities are not established through other
      means.  If this parameter is absent, either the RSs in the group-
      audience do not use a public key, or the AS knows that the RSs can
      authenticate themselves to C without additional information.

      If included, this parameter MUST encode a non-empty array of N
      elements, where N is the number of RSs in the group-audience for
      which the access token is issued.  The array is encoded as a CBOR
      array or a JSON array, depending on whether the access token
      response is encoded in CBOR or JSON, respectively.

      Each element of the array specifies the public key of an RS in the
      group-audience, and MUST follow the syntax and semantics of the
      "cnf" claim either from Section 3.1 of [RFC8747] for CBOR-based
      interactions, or from Section 3.1 of [RFC7800] for JSON-based
      interactions.  It is not required that all the elements of the
      array rely on the same confirmation method.

      Any of the public keys may be provided together with information
      such as the public key algorithm and use (e.g., specified by means
      of the parameters "alg" and "key_ops" in a COSE_Key structure).
      If such information is specified, a client MUST NOT use a public
      key that is incompatible with the profile of ACE used or with the
      PoP algorithm according to that information.  An RS MUST reject a
      proof of possession that relies on such a key and MUST reply with
      a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request).

   *  The "audience2" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an access
      token response, and it specifies the identifiers of the RSs in the
      group-audience for which the access token is issued.

      The "audience2" parameter MUST NOT be included if the issued
      access token is not the first one of a new token series.

      If included, this parameter MUST encode a non-empty array of N
      elements, where N is the number of RSs in the group-audience for
      which the access token is issued.  The array is encoded as a CBOR
      array or a JSON array, depending on whether the access token
      response is encoded in CBOR or JSON, respectively.

      Each element of the array in the "audience2" parameter specifies
      the identifier of an RS in the group-audience.  The value of each
      element of the array is encoded as a CBOR text string or a JSON
      string, depending on whether the access token response is encoded
      in CBOR or JSON, respectively.

      The element of the array referring to an RS in the group-audience
      SHOULD have the same value that would be used to identify that RS
      through the "audience" parameter of an access token request to the
      AS (see Section 5.8.1 of [RFC9200]) and of an access token
      response from the AS (see Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]), when
      requesting and issuing an access token for that individual RS.

      The "audience2" parameter MUST be included if the "rs_cnf2"
      parameter is included.  In such a case, the i-th element of the
      array in the "audience2" parameter MUST be the identifier of the
      RS whose public key is specified by the i-th element of the array
      in the "rs_cnf2" parameter.

3.4.1.  Example

   Figure 8 shows an example of access token response from the AS to C,
   following the issue of an access token for a group-audience composed
   of two RSs, namely "rs1" and "rs2", and bound to C's public key as an
   asymmetric PoP key.  The access token response includes the access
   token as well as the parameters "audience2" and "rs_cnf2".  These
   parameters specify the public key of the two RSs as the intended
   recipients of the access token and the identifiers of those two RSs,
   respectively.

      bound to an asymmetric key, using the parameters "audience2" and

3.5.  anchor_cnf

   This section defines the additional "anchor_cnf" parameter.  The
   parameter can be used in an access token response sent by the AS (see
   Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]), in reply to an access token request sent
   to the token endpoint by C.

   The "anchor_cnf" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an access token
   response, if the token type is "pop" and asymmetric keys are used.
   Otherwise, the "anchor_cnf" parameter MUST NOT be included.

   Also, the "anchor_cnf" parameter MUST NOT be included if the issued
   access token is not the first one of a new token series.

   This parameter specifies information about the public keys of trust
   anchors, which C can use to validate the public key of the RS/RSs
   included in the audience for which the access token is issued.  This
   parameter can be used when the access token is issued for an audience
   including one RS or multiple RSs.

   If this parameter is absent, either the RS/RSs in the audience do not
   use a public key, or the AS knows that C can validate the public key
   of such RS/RSs without additional information (e.g., C has already
   obtained the required public keys of the involved trust anchors from
   the AS or through other means).

   If included, this parameter MUST encode a non-empty array that MUST
   be treated as a set, i.e., the order of its elements has no meaning.
   Each element of the array specifies the public key of one trust
   anchor, which can be used to validate the public key of at least one
   RS included in the audience for which the access token is issued.
   The array is encoded as a CBOR array or a JSON array, depending on
   whether the access token response is encoded in CBOR or JSON,
   respectively.

   Each element of the array MUST follow the syntax and semantics of the
   "cnf" claim either from Section 3.1 of [RFC8747] for CBOR-based
   interactions, or from Section 3.1 of [RFC7800] for JSON-based
   interactions.  It is not required that all the elements of the array
   rely on the same confirmation method.

   Any of the public keys conveyed in the "anchor_cnf" parameter may be
   provided together with information such as the public key algorithm
   and use (e.g., specified by means of the parameters "alg" and
   "key_ops" in a COSE_Key structure).  If such information is
   specified, a client MUST NOT use a public key that is incompatible
   with the profile of ACE used or with the public keys to validate and
   the way to validate those.

   The presence of this parameter does not require that the access token
   response also includes the "rs_cnf" parameter defined in [RFC9201] or
   the "rs_cnf2" parameter defined in Section 3.4 of the present
   document.  That is, C may be able to obtain the public keys of the
   RS/RSs for which the access token is issued through other means.

   When the access token response includes both the "anchor_cnf"
   parameter and the "audience2" parameter defined in Section 3.4, then
   C MUST make sure that a public key PK_RS is associated with an RS
   identified by an element of "audience2", before using any of the
   public keys specified in "anchor_cnf" to validate PK_RS.

   When the access token response includes the "anchor_cnf" parameter
   but not the "audience2" parameter, then C can use any of the public
   keys specified in "anchor_cnf" to validate the public key PK_RS of
   any RS in the targeted audience.  This allows C to use the access
   token with an RS that is deployed later on as part of the same
   audience, which is particularly useful in the case of a group-
   audience.

3.5.1.  Example

   Figure 9 shows an example of access token response from the AS to C,
   following the issue of an access token for a group-audience and bound
   to C's public key as an asymmetric PoP key.

   The identifier of the group-audience was specified by the "audience"
   parameter of the access token request to the AS, is specified by the
   "aud" claim of the issued access token, and is not repeated in the
   access token response from the AS.

   The access token response includes the "anchor_cnf" parameter.  This
   specifies the public key of a trust anchor that C can use to validate
   the public keys of any RS with which the access token is going to be
   used.  By means of the CWT confirmation method "x5chain" defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile], the public key of the trust
   anchor is here conveyed within an X.509 certificate [RFC5280] used as
   the public authentication credential for that trust anchor.

       bound to an asymmetric key, using the "anchor_cnf" parameter.

3.6.  token_series_id

   This section defines the additional "token_series_id" parameter.  The
   parameter can be used in an access token request sent by C to the
   token endpoint at the AS (see Section 5.8.1 of [RFC9200]), as well as
   in the access token response sent as a reply by the AS (see
   Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]).

   The following refers to the base64url encoding without padding (see
   Section 5 of [RFC4648]).

   *  The "token_series_id" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an
      access token request.  The presence of this parameter indicates
      that C wishes to obtain a new access token for dynamically
      updating its access rights.  That is, the new access token is
      intended to be the next one in an active token series and to
      supersede the latest access token in that token series.

      The "token_series_id" parameter MUST NOT be included in an access
      token request, if the requested access token is the first one of a
      new token series.

      If included, this parameter specifies the binary identifier of the
      token series that the new access token is intended to extend.  The
      identifier does not change throughout the lifetime of the token
      series and was provided to C in the access token response that the
      AS sent when issuing the first access token in that token series.

      When the access token request is encoded in CBOR, this parameter
      is a CBOR byte string, with value the identifier of the token
      series.  When the access token request is encoded in JSON, this
      parameter has as value the base64url-encoded text string that
      encodes the identifier of the token series.

   *  The "token_series_id" parameter is OPTIONAL to include in an
      access token response.

      The "token_series_id" parameter MUST NOT be included in an access
      token response, if the issued access token is not the first one of
      a new token series.

      If included, this parameter specifies the binary identifier of the
      token series to which the issued access token belongs.

      When the access token response is encoded in CBOR, this parameter
      is a CBOR byte string, with value the identifier of the token
      series.  When the access token request is encoded in JSON, this
      parameter has as value the base64url-encoded text string that
      encodes the identifier of the token series.

   If the AS relies on the "token_series_id" parameter to exchange the
   identifier of token series with clients, then the following applies.

   *  The value assigned to the identifier of a token series MUST be
      associated with all the access tokens issued by the AS for that
      token series and MUST be selected from a pool that the AS
      exclusively controls.

      In particular, the triple (TS_ID, C, AUD) MUST uniquely identify a
      token series and its corresponding access tokens, where TS_ID is
      the identifier of the token series, while C and AUD are the client
      and the audience for which the access token is issued,
      respectively.  The AS MUST take into account both ongoing and
      ended token series for selecting a new TS_ID that complies with
      the above requirements.

      Note that the ACE profile is not part of the triple, hence the
      requirement spans across all the ACE profiles that the AS and its
      registered clients/RSs support.

   *  An issued access token that belongs to a token series MUST include
      the identifier of that token series.  This allows the RS to
      identify the latest access token in the token series to be
      superseded by the issued access token.

      In particular, each of such access tokens MUST include a claim
      specifying the identifier of the token series to which the access
      token belongs.

      When CWTs are used as access tokens, this information MUST be
      transported in the "token_series_id" claim registered in
      Section 10.4, which has the same semantics as the
      "token_series_id" parameter of an access token response encoded in
      CBOR.

      When JWTs are used as access tokens, this information MUST be
      transported in the "token_series_id" claim registered in
      Section 10.3, which has the same semantics as the
      "token_series_id" parameter of an access token response encoded in
      JSON.

   If a profile of ACE relies on a construct that uses different
   parameters/claims to transport the identifier of a token series, then
   the new "token_series_id" parameter and "token_series_id" claim MUST
   NOT be used when using that profile.

   For example, a number of parameters/claims are already used to
   transport information that acts as de facto identifier of token
   series, in the PSK mode of the DTLS profile [RFC9202], in the OSCORE
   profile [RFC9203], and in the EDHOC and OSCORE profile
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

3.7.  updated_rights

   This section defines the additional "updated_rights" parameter.  The
   parameter can be used in a POST request sent by the AS to the authz-
   info endpoint at the RS (see Section 5.10.1 of [RFC9200]), when the
   AS uploads an access token to the RS per the SDC workflow defined in
   Section 2 of the present document.  The "updated_rights" parameter
   MUST NOT be included in the POST request to the authz-info endpoint
   sent by C per the original workflow defined in [RFC9200].

   The "updated_rights" parameter MUST be included in the POST request
   sent by the AS to the authz-info endpoint at the RS, if the uploaded
   access token is not the first one of a new token series, i.e., if the
   AS has issued the access token for dynamically updating the access
   rights of C.  Otherwise, the "updated_rights" parameter MUST NOT be
   included.

   When including the "updated_rights" parameter, the following applies:

   *  If the POST request in encoded in CBOR, the request MUST have
      media type "application/ace+cbor" and its payload MUST be
      formatted as a CBOR map.  In particular, the CBOR map MUST include
      the "updated_rights" parameter encoding the CBOR simple value true
      (0xf5), together with the "access_token" parameter specifying the
      access token.  The CBOR map MAY include additional parameters,
      according to the specific profile of ACE used.

   *  If the POST request in encoded in JSON, the request MUST have
      media type "application/ace+json" and its payload MUST be
      formatted as a JSON object.  In particular, the JSON object MUST
      include the "updated_rights" parameter with value true, together
      with the "access_token" parameter specifying the access token.
      The JSON object MAY include additional parameters, according to
      the specific profile of ACE used.

   The rest of this section focuses on interactions with the authz-info
   endpoint at the RS where messages are encoded in CBOR.  The same as
   described below holds in case such messages are encoded in JSON, with
   the difference that the "updated_rights" parameter with value true
   can be present within a JSON object conveyed by a POST request to the
   authz-info endpoint.

   Note that this request deviates from the POST request defined in
   [RFC9200], although such a deviation can already occur in some
   profiles of ACE (e.g., see Section 4.1 of [RFC9203]) or in
   application profiles of [RFC9594].

   When the RS receives a protected POST request to the authz-info
   endpoint from the AS and the request does not convey the
   "updated_rights" parameter, the RS is ensured that the access token
   conveyed in the request is the first one of a new token series.

   When the RS receives a protected POST request to the authz-info
   endpoint from the AS and the request conveys the "updated_rights"
   parameter encoding the CBOR simple value true (0xf5), the RS is
   ensured that the access token conveyed in the request is not the
   first one of a new token series.

   Taking advantage of such explicit indication requires the RS to
   support the Content-Format "application/ace+cbor" and the
   "updated_rights" parameter.

   If the RS does not support the Content-Format "application/ace+cbor",
   the RS rejects the POST request from the AS and replies with an error
   response that has a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.15
   (Unsupported Content-Format).  Note that, irrespective of the profile
   of ACE used, the RS supports the Content-Format "application/
   ace+cbor" if it implements token introspection as defined in
   Section 5.9 of [RFC9200].

   If the RS supports the Content-Format "application/ace+cbor" but does
   not support the "updated_rights" parameter, the RS rejects the POST
   request from the AS and replies with an error response that has a
   response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request).

   In case a POST request to the authz-info endpoint includes the
   "updated_rights" parameter, the RS supports the parameter, and any of
   the following conditions applies, the RS MUST reject the request and
   MUST reply with an error response that has a response code equivalent
   to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request):

   *  The request is not protected.

   *  The AS is not successfully verified as the originator of the
      request.

   *  The "updated_rights" parameter does not encode the CBOR simple
      value true (0xf5).

   If the AS receives an error response from the RS, the AS replies to C
   with an access token response, which includes the "access_token"
   parameter specifying the issued access token and includes the
   "token_upload" parameter encoding the value 1 (see Section 3.1).

   The processing of the POST request sent to the authz-info endpoint by
   the AS is further described in Section 2.1.

4.  Updated "ace_profile" Parameter

   This section extends the semantics of the "ace_profile" parameter
   defined in [RFC9200] for the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint at the AS.

   In addition to what is specified in Sections 5.8.1, 5.8.2, and
   5.8.4.3 of [RFC9200], the following applies.

   *  When sending an access token request to the token endpoint at the
      AS (see Section 5.8.1 of [RFC9200]), C MAY include the
      "ace_profile" parameter, specifying the identifier of the profile
      that C wishes to use towards the RS.

      The "ace_profile" parameter MUST NOT be included in an access
      token request, if the requested access token is not the first one
      of a new token series.

   *  If the AS receives an access token request for requesting the
      first access token in a new token series and the request includes
      the "ace_profile" parameter specifying the identifier of a
      profile, then the AS proceeds as follows.

      In case the AS does not issue access tokens per the profile
      specified in the access token request, or C and the RS do not
      share that profile, then the AS MUST reject the request and MUST
      reply with an error response (see Section 5.8.3 of [RFC9200]).
      The error response MUST have a response code equivalent to the
      CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request) and MUST include the error code
      "incompatible_ace_profiles".

      In case the AS issues an access token to C, the access token MUST
      be per the profile whose identifier was specified by the
      "ace_profile" parameter in the access token request.

      In case the AS replies to C with an access token response (see
      Section 5.8.2 of [RFC9200]), then the response MAY include the
      "ace_profile" parameter.  If it is included in the access token
      response, the "ace_profile" parameter MUST encode the same profile
      identifier that was specified by the "ace_profile" parameter of
      the corresponding access token request.

      The "ace_profile" parameter MUST NOT be included in the access
      token response, if the issued access token is not the first one of
      a new token series.

5.  Coordinating on the Exchange of Public Authentication Credentials

   In some profiles of ACE, it is possible for C and the RS to use
   public authentication credentials.  Depending on the specific
   profile, the access token request and response exchanged between C
   and the AS can specify those authentication credentials as
   transported by value or instead identified by reference.  For
   instance, this is the case in the EDHOC and OSCORE profile
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile] and in the DTLS profile [RFC9202]
   as extended in [I-D.ietf-ace-authcred-dtls-profile].

   At some point, the AS (C) might become unable to use a credential
   identifier as a reference for accessing the authentication credential
   of C (of the RS) obtained earlier, e.g., due to having deleted the
   credential from its local storage.  This can prevent the AS (C) from
   successfully processing an incoming access token request (response)
   that specifies the authentication credential of C (of the RS) as
   identified by reference.  Ultimately, this can prevent the AS from
   issuing an access token and C from securely accessing protected
   resources at the RS.

   Conversely, unbeknown to the AS, C might already be storing the
   authentication credential of the RS when sending the access token
   request.  In such a situation, the AS would specify the
   authentication credential of the RS by value in the access token
   response.  However, it would be sufficient for C that the response
   specified the credential of the RS as identified by reference, or
   even that the response omitted the credential altogether.

   In order to allow C and the AS to coordinate on the exchange of the
   authentication credentials of C and the RS, the rest of this section
   defines:

   *  How the AS can instruct C to specify its public authentication
      credential by value in the "req_cnf" parameter of an access token
      request (see Section 5.1).

   *  How C can instruct the AS to specify the public authentication
      credential(s) of the RS(s) by value or by reference in the
      "rs_cnf" or "rs_cnf2" parameter of an access token response (see
      Section 5.2), or instead to omit the credential(s) from the access
      token response.

5.1.  Instructing C on How to Provide its Authentication Credential

   When the AS receives an access token request and this includes the
   "req_cnf" parameter identifying the public authentication credential
   of C by reference, it might happen that the AS is not able to access
   the credential by using the specified reference.

   In such a case, the AS MUST reject the request and MUST reply with an
   error response (see Section 5.8.3 of [RFC9200]).  The error response
   MUST have a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 5.00 (Internal
   Server Error) and MUST include the error code
   "unknown_credential_referenced".  The error code and its CBOR
   abbreviation are registered in Section 10.5 and Section 10.6,
   respectively.

   After receiving such an error response, C can send a new access token
   request, where the "req_cnf" parameter specifies the authentication
   credential of C by value.

5.2.  Instructing the AS on How to Provide the RS's Authentication
      Credential

   When C receives an access token response and this includes the
   "req_cnf" or "req_cnf2" parameter identifying the authentication
   credential(s) of the RS(s) by reference, it might happen that C is
   not able to access the authentication credential(s) by using the
   specified reference(s).

   Conversely, if the response includes the "rs_cnf" or "rs_cnf2"
   parameter specifying the authentication credential(s) of the RS(s) by
   value, it might happen that C has already been storing those
   credential(s), unbeknown to the AS.  In fact, it would have been
   sufficient that the "rs_cnf" or "rs_cnf2" parameter identified the
   credential(s) by reference, or that neither parameter was included in
   the response.

   The following extends the semantics of the "rs_cnf" parameter defined
   in Section 3.2 of [RFC9201], so that C can include the "rs_cnf"
   parameter in an access token request.  When doing so, C instructs the
   AS about whether and how the access token response should specify the
   authentication credential(s) of the RS(s) belonging to the targeted
   audience.

   Per its extended semantics, the "rs_cnf" parameter is also OPTIONAL
   to include in an access token request when requesting the first
   access token in a token series, if the token type is "pop" and
   asymmetric keys are used.  In any other case, the parameter MUST NOT
   be included in an access token request.

   When C includes the "rs_cnf" parameter in an access token request
   encoded in CBOR, the parameter MUST have one of the following
   encodings.

   *  If the parameter specifies the CBOR simple value true (0xf5), then
      it instructs the AS to include in the access token response the
      "rs_cnf" or "rs_cnf2" parameter, specifying the authentication
      credential(s) of the RS(s) by value.

      In the access token response, each pertaining authentication
      credential MUST be specified by value.

   *  If the parameter specifies the CBOR simple value false (0xf4),
      then it instructs the AS to include in the access token response
      the "rs_cnf" or "rs_cnf2" parameter, specifying the authentication
      credential(s) of the RS(s) by reference.

      In the access token response, each pertaining authentication
      credential MUST be specified by reference, or alternatively by
      value only in case that was not possible for the AS to attain.

   *  If the parameter specifies the CBOR simple value null (0xf6), then
      it instructs the AS to omit the "rs_cnf" and "rs_cnf2" parameters
      from the access token response.

      In the access token response, the "rs_cnf" and "rs_cnf2"
      parameters MUST NOT be included.

   If the access token request is encoded in JSON, the same as above
   applies, with the difference that the "rs_cnf" parameter specifies as
   appropriate the corresponding JSON values true, false, or null.

   If the AS is not able to comply in the first two cases above, then
   the AS MUST reject the request and MUST reply with an error response.
   The error response MUST have a response code equivalent to the CoAP
   code 5.00 (Internal Server Error).

   Irrespective of what "rs_cnf" specifies in the access token request,
   C MUST rely on the authentication credential(s) specified by the
   parameter "rs_cnf" or "rs_cnf2" in the access token response, as
   those that are used by the RS(s) to authenticate.

   If C does not currently store the authentication credential(s) of the
   RS(s), then the following applies:

   *  C MUST NOT include the "rs_cnf" parameter specifying the CBOR
      simple value null (0xf6) in an access token request encoded in
      CBOR, or the value null in an access token request encoded in
      JSON.

   *  C SHOULD NOT include the "rs_cnf" parameter specifying the CBOR
      simple value false (0xf4) in an access token request encoded in
      CBOR, or the value false in an access token request encoded in
      JSON.  Exceptions apply if C is confident that it can later
      acquire and validate the authentication credential(s) of the RS(s)
      by other means, e.g., by using the references provided by the AS
      for retrieval from a trusted repository.

6.  Failed Verification of Proof of Possession at the AS

   When sending an access token request to the AS (see Section 5.8.1 of
   [RFC9200]), a client can include the "req_cnf" parameter defined in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC9201] in order to provide the AS with a specific
   PoP key to bind to the requested access token.

   Typically, the PoP key in question is the client's public key.  In
   such a case, as per Section 3.1 of [RFC9201], the AS has to verify
   proof of possession of the client's private key, i.e., that the
   client is indeed in possession of the private key corresponding to
   the public key conveyed in the "req_cnf" parameter.

   The AS might have previously achieved proof of possession of the
   private key in question, e.g., from previous interactions with the
   client or through out-of-band means.  Alternatively, a profile of ACE
   might define how the AS verifies a PoP evidence that the client
   computes and provides to the AS by means of a parameter included in
   the access token request (e.g., see
   [I-D.ietf-ace-group-oscore-profile]).

   Irrespective of the method used, if the AS fails to verify the proof
   of possession of the client's private key, then the AS MUST reject
   the access token request and MUST reply with an error response (see
   Section 5.8.3 of [RFC9200]).  The error response MUST have a response
   code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request) and MUST include
   the error code "failed_pop_verification".  The error code and its
   CBOR abbreviation are registered in Section 10.5 and Section 10.6,
   respectively.

7.  Updated Payload Format of Error Responses

   This section deprecates the original payload format of error
   responses conveying an error code, when CBOR is used to encode
   message payloads in the ACE framework.  That format is referred to,
   e.g., when defining the error responses of Sections 5.8.3 and 5.9.3
   of [RFC9200].

   Also, this section defines a new payload format that allows such
   error responses to convey an error code together with further error-
   specific information, according to the problem-details format
   specified in [RFC9290].

   Such error responses MUST have Content-Format set to "application/
   concise-problem-details+cbor".  The payload of these error responses
   MUST be a CBOR map specifying a Concise Problem Details data item
   (see Section 2 of [RFC9290]).  The CBOR map is formatted as follows:

   *  It MUST include the Custom Problem Detail entry "ace-error"
      registered in Section 10.7 of this document.

      This entry is formatted as a CBOR map including only one field,
      namely "error-code".  The map key for the "error-code" field is
      the CBOR integer with value 0.  The value of the "error-code"
      field is a CBOR integer specifying the error code associated with
      the occurred error.  This value is taken from the "CBOR Value"
      column of the "OAuth Error Code CBOR Mappings" registry
      [ACE.OAuth.Error.Code.CBOR.Mappings].

      The "error-code" field conveys the same information that the
      original payload format conveys through the "error" parameter
      (see, e.g., Sections 5.8.3 and 5.9.3 of [RFC9200]).

      The CDDL notation [RFC8610] of the "ace-error" entry is given
      below.

      ace-error = {
        &(error-code: 0) => int
      }

   *  It MAY include further Standard Problem Detail entries or Custom
      Problem Detail entries (see [RFC9290]).  The following Standard
      Problem Detail entries are of particular relevance for the ACE
      framework.

      -  "detail" (map key -2): its value is a CBOR text string that
         specifies a human-readable diagnostic description of the
         occurred error (see Section 2 of [RFC9290]).

         The diagnostic text is intended for software engineers as well
         as for device and network operators in order to aid in
         debugging and provide context for possible intervention.  The
         diagnostic message SHOULD be logged by the sender of the error
         response.  The "detail" entry is unlikely to be relevant in an
         unattended setup where human intervention is not expected.

         When the Standard Problem Detail entry "detail" is included, it
         conveys the same information that the original payload format
         conveys through the "error_description" parameter (see, e.g.,
         Sections 5.8.3 and 5.9.3 of [RFC9200]).

      -  "instance" (map key -3): its value is a URI reference
         identifying the specific occurrence of the error (see Section 2
         of [RFC9290]).

         When the Standard Problem Detail entry "instance" is included,
         it conveys the same information that the original payload
         format conveys through the "error_uri" parameter (see, e.g.,
         Sections 5.8.3 and 5.9.3 of [RFC9200]).

   An example of an error response using the problem-details format is
   shown in Figure 10.

   Header: Bad Request (Code=4.00)
   Content-Format: 257 (application/concise-problem-details+cbor)
   Payload:
   {
     / title /  -1 : "Incompatible ACE profile",
     / detail / -2 : "The RS supports only the OSCORE profile",
       e'ace-error': {
         / error_code / 0: 8 / incompatible_ace_profiles /
       }
   }

         Figure 10: Example of Error Response with Problem Details.

   When the ACE framework is used with CBOR for encoding message
   payloads, the following applies.

   *  It is RECOMMENDED that authorization servers, clients, and
      resource servers support the payload format defined in this
      section.

   *  Authorization servers, clients, and resource servers that support
      the payload format defined in this section MUST use it when
      composing an outgoing error response that conveys an error code.

8.  Updated Requirements on Profiles of ACE

   Appendix C of [RFC9200] compiles a list of requirements on the
   profiles of ACE.  This document amends two of those requirements as
   follows.

   The text of the fifth requirement

   |  Specify the security protocol the client and RS must use to
   |  protect their communication (e.g., OSCORE or DTLS).  This must
   |  provide encryption and integrity and replay protection
   |  (Section 5.8.4.3).

   is replaced by the following text:

   |  Specify the security protocol the client and RS must use to
   |  protect their communication (e.g., OSCORE or DTLS).  In
   |  combination with the used communication protocol, this must
   |  provide encryption, integrity and replay protection, and a binding
   |  between requests and responses (Section 5.8.4.3 and Section 6.5).

   The text of the tenth requirement

   |  Specify the communication and security protocol for interactions
   |  between the client and AS.  This must provide encryption,
   |  integrity protection, replay protection, and a binding between
   |  requests and responses (Sections 5 and 5.8).

   is replaced by the following text:

   |  Specify the communication and security protocol for interactions
   |  between the client and AS.  The combined use of those protocols
   |  must provide encryption, integrity protection, replay protection,
   |  and a binding between requests and responses (Sections 5 and 5.8).

   At the time of writing, all the profiles of ACE that are published as
   RFC (i.e., [RFC9202][RFC9203][RFC9431]) already comply with the two
   updated requirements as formulated above.

9.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations from the ACE framework for
   Authentication and Authorization [RFC9200] apply to this document,
   together with those from the specific profile of ACE used, e.g., [RFC
   9202][RFC9203][RFC9431][I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile][I-D.ietf-a
   ce-group-oscore-profile][RFC9431].

   When using the problem-details format defined in [RFC9290] for error
   responses, then the privacy and security considerations from Sections
   4 and 5 of [RFC9290] also apply.

   Editor's note: add more security considerations.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has the following actions for IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of "[RFC-XXXX]"
   with the RFC number of this specification and delete this paragraph.

Appendix A.  Benefits for ACE Profiles

   For any profile of ACE, the following holds.

   *  The SDC workflow defined in Section 2 is effectively possible to
      use.  This is beneficial for deployments where the communication
      leg between C and the RS is constrained, but the communication leg
      between the AS and RS is not.

   *  When the SDC workflow is used, the "token_upload" parameter
      defined in Section 3.1 is used:

      -  To inform the AS about C opting in to use the SDC workflow.

      -  To request the AS that the follow-up access token response
         includes certain information, if the AS has successfully
         uploaded the access token to the RS.

      -  To inform C that the AS has attempted to upload the issued
         access token to the RS, specifying whether the uploading has
         succeeded or failed.

   *  When the SDC workflow is used, it remains possible for C to always
      obtain the issued access token from the AS.

      That is, by specifying the value 2 for the "token_upload"
      parameter in the access token request, C will ensure to receive
      the access token from the AS, even if the AS successfully uploads
      the access token to the RS on behalf of C.

      This is useful in profiles of ACE where C can re-upload the same
      access token to the RS by itself, e.g., in order to perform a key
      update like defined for the OSCORE profile [RFC9203].

A.1.  DTLS Profile

   When the RPK mode of the DTLS profile is used (see Section 3.2 of
   [RFC9202]), it becomes possible for the AS to effectively issue an
   access token intended to an audience that includes multiple RSs.

   This is enabled by the parameters "rs_cnf2" and "audience2" defined
   in Section 3.4, as well as by the "anchor_cnf" parameter defined in
   Section 3.5.  This seamlessly applies also if the profile uses
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446] as defined in [RFC9430].

A.2.  EDHOC and OSCORE Profile

   When the EDHOC and OSCORE profile is used
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile], it becomes possible for the AS
   to effectively issue an access token intended to an audience that
   includes multiple RSs.

   This is enabled by the parameters "rs_cnf2" and "audience2" defined
   in Section 3.4, as well as by the "anchor_cnf" parameter defined in
   Section 3.5.
